# odin-etch-a-sketch
This is a virtual Etch-a-Sketch I made while going through The Odin Project. While (visually) pretty barebones, it satisfies everything the assignment asks for. 
This was my first big project with JavaScript and I'm pleasently surprised at how well I was able to make it, as well as how intuitive a lot of the logic in JS was. 
I think I have a really solid foundational understanding of event listeners and how JS interacts with html and css files. I'm going to spend some time making a version of this that's a little more 
fleshed out. Still very proud of what I have here, though :).
